\begin_layout Abstract
FE method is one of the most useful approaches to study the mechanical propertie
s of a CNT-reinforced composite on bulk levels.
 However due to the extreme complexity of the CNT net morphology, it is
 almost impossible to create a FE model for a realistic composite.
 Multiple assumptions are made to reduce the difficulties of creating the
 FE model in the past decades, but they can only reveal part of the realistic
 phenomena.
 In this study, an Immersed FE method is proposed which allows for the CNT
 and polymer model to be created independently and simulated coupled.
 The basic assumption is the CNT and polymer are fully bonded, and the equilibri
um equation of each CNT is embedded into the equilibrium equation of the
 polymer according to the Newton's third law.
 The most important advantage of the Immersed FE method is that the polymer
 can always be meshed as a regular grid no matter how complex the CNT nets
 are.
 So it is possible to simulate realistic composites because the difficulty
 of creating a realistic CNT net model is much less than creating a realistic
 composite model.
 Numerical examples are presented to validate the results of the Immersed
 FE method are very close to the results of the traditional FE method.
 A simple application of the Immersed FE method is also presented which
 studies the the mechanic properties of composites reinforced by the uniformly
 dispersed straight CNTs with different volume fraction.

\begin_layout Standard
In the area of nanocomposite science, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted
 considerable interest due to their remarkable mechanical and physical propertie
s, such as such as low density

 and high thermal and electrical conductivity

\end_inset

.
 These superior properties make it an excellent choice to reinforce pure
 polymer as the multi-functional composite.
 In the past few decades, intensive attentions are paid to understand the
 mechanical behavior of the nanocomposite through experimental

\begin_layout Standard
Numerical simulation is widely used in studying the mechanical properties
 of nanocomposites and a variety of modeling methods are developed for different
 scale of interest.
 The Molecular Dynamics (MD) method is designed for the nano-scale simulation.
 The constitutive relations of the MD method are derived from the inter-atomic
 potentials, and the motion of each atom in the system is based on the forces
 applying on it.
 MD method is able to see the details of every atom, so it can be used to
 study the complex phenomena in nano-scale, such as the interfacial properties
 between CNT and polymer
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MD01,MD02,MD03"

\end_inset

, the effect of the chemical functionalization on carbon atoms
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MD04,MD05"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 and the influence of the defect in the CNT
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MD06,MD07"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 However, even with the usage of the most advanced supercomputers, only
 about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{9}$
\end_inset

 atoms, namely about 1000 atoms in each direction, can be simulated
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MD08"

\end_inset

.
 So it is unrealistic to use MD method in a larger scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enlarge the simulation scale, the traditional continuum model is introduced
 which assumes the material to be homogeneous and neglects the details of
 atomic structures.
 Although the traditional continuum models cannot accurately describe the
 phenomena in nano-scale, it is able to provide valuable information to
 study the influences of the micro-scale parameters, such as the CNT curvature

\begin_layout Standard
Finite Element (FE) method is the most commonly used technique to simulate
 nanocomposites in micro-scale.
 However due to the extreme complexity of the CNT net morphology, such as
 waviness, agglomeration and aggreation, it is almost impossible to create
 a FE model for a realistic composite.
 The major challenge comes from the meshing process because traditional
 FE method requires the CNT and polymer grids to be matched to each other.
 The difficulty increases significantly with the increment of CNT number
 and morphological complexity.
 Lusti and Gusev created the traditional FE model of composites with straight
 CNTs

 and Fig.

 shows the grid.
 It is obvious that the grid should be very difficult to be created and
 a lot of highly distorted meshes appear in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

(b) which may decrease the accuracy of the results.
 The volume fraction of CNT is only 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\%$
\end_inset

 but the composite is meshed into 
\begin_inset Formula $2.6\times10^{7}$
\end_inset

 elements.
 Alian and Meguid also used the traditional FE model to study the mechanical-ele
ctrical behavior of composites reinforced by straight CNTs
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "FE05"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, but due to the difficulties in meshing, the CNT volume fraction is only
 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3\%$
\end_inset

 in their research.
 The problem can be even more severe when consider the waviness and agglomeratio
n in the realistic composites.

\begin_layout Standard
In order to avoid the complicated meshing process, many assumptions are
 made in the past.
 The simplest way is to reduce the number of CNT and the morphological complexit
y.
 For instance, Fisher studied the influence of the waviness by FE models
 which contain only a single nanotube

\end_inset

 and Chen did research about the mechanical response of composites with
 regular CNT distribution
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

\end_inset

.
 The other way is to use the effective composite material properties which
 are calculated from the Moriâ€“Tanaka model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite
key "MT"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The CNT net dose not need to be meshed explicitly in this method, but the
 details of the CNT deformation are also ignored

 The

embedded element technique
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

literal "false"

\end_inset

 is also an approach to simplify the meshing process.
 The CNTs are meshed as beam elements and their freedom degrees are embedded
 into the polymer by modifying the stiffness matrix of each polymer element.
 Only kinematic relation between CNT and polymer is considered in this method
 while the more important issue, the interacting forces in between, is not
 accounted for.
 Moreover, the usage of beam element also fails to consider the effect of
 different Poisson's ratio between CNT and polymer.
 In summary, the simplification of the meshing process also decreases the
 accuracy of the results, so these methods can only reveal part of the realistic
 phenomena.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, an Immersed Finite Element method is proposed which not only
 simplifies the meshing process but also provides results in high accuracy.
 In this method, the CNT and polymer grids are both meshed into solid elements
 and they are allowed to be created independently.
 It means that the polymer can always be meshed as a regular grid no matter
 how complex the CNT nets are.
 The CNT net and polymer are simulated coupled according to a basic 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

fully bonded
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 assumption.
 Rather than the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

embedded element technique
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 which just embed the CNT freedom degree, the equilibrium equation of each
 CNT is embedded into the equilibrium equation of the polymer according
 to the Newton's third law.
 Therefore, both kinematic and mechanic relations between CNT and polymer
 are considered in the Immersed FE method.
 The accuracy of the Immersed FE method are validated by comparing the results
 with the traditional FE method, and numerical examples demonstrate that
 they are very close to the results of the traditional FE method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It should be mentioned that the Immersed FE method is not only suitable
 to simulate the nanotube-reinforced composites, it can also be used to
 simulate the mechanical behavior of particle-reinforced composites in the
 same way.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polymer and the CNTs are both meshed with 8 node hexahedral elements
 in the proposed Immersed FE method but they are not matched.
 So the basic assumption is the polymer and CNTs are fully bonded, namely
 the displacement of the CNT surface nodes equals to the local polymer displacem
ent.
 This assumption is widely used in continuum model
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand cite

 although they are not perfectly bonded in reality and may influence to
 effective material properties
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

.
 But it is also reasonable for small deformation where the stress in CNT
 can fully transferred to the polymer

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Immersed FE method, the CNTs' grid are not matched with the polymer
 grid, so the displacement of the CNT surface nodes should be gathered from
 the surrounding polymer nodes.
 Once the surface displacement of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 CNT, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}$
\end_inset

, is determined, the internal displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,I}}$
\end_inset

 and the reacting force 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}}$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by solving the equilibrium equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,II}} & \boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,IB}}\\
\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,BI}} & \boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,BB}}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,I}}\\
\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{0}\\
\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}}
\end{array}\right]\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}}$
\end_inset

 is the force that the polymer applies on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

, so the force that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

 applies on polymer is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}}$
\end_inset

 according to the Newton's third law.
 It should be mentioned that this force are not exactly applied on the polymer
 nodes, so it should be scattered to the surrounding polymer nodes.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}$
\end_inset

 is calculated is from the polymer displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}$
\end_inset

, the force that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

 applies on the polymer should also be a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}$
\end_inset

 and denote it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, the equilibrium equation of polymer is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}=\sum_{i}\boldsymbol{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\right)+\boldsymbol{f}^{\textrm{Polymer,react}}\label{eq:2}

 For the

 polymer freedom degree to the

\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{T}_{i}$

 must be a positive definite matrix due the conservation of energy.
 Therefore, the force that

\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{C2P}}=-\boldsymbol{T}_{i}\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}

 into Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 leads to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}

\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}+\boldsymbol{S}$
\end_inset

 is the total stiffness matrix of the nanocomposite which contains the original
 stiffness from the polymer, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}$
\end_inset

, and the reinforced stiffness from CNTs, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strictly speaking, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}$
\end_inset

 should not be equal to the stiffness matrix of the pure polymer 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because the CNTs in the composite occupy some space of the polymer
 and thus, decrease the stiffness of the polymer.
 Nevertheless, due to the fact that the volume fraction of the nanocomposite
 is very low (generally less than 5%), and the stiffness of CNT is much
 higher than that of the polymer (about 300 times), the magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}_{0}-\boldsymbol{K}$
\end_inset

 should be much less than the magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}$
\end_inset

.
 So in this paper, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}_{0}$
\end_inset

 is used in Eq.

and the Finally equation to be solved is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{II}}+\boldsymbol{S}^{\textrm{II}}\right)\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{I}}=-\left(\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{IB}}+\boldsymbol{S}^{\textrm{IB}}\right)\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{B}}\label{eq:12}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It should be mentioned that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{II}}$
\end_inset

 is a positive definite matrix and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}^{\textrm{II}}$

 Generally, the results of effective stress and CNT displacement from Immersed
 FE method are very close to the traditional FE method on both polymer grid.
 Moreover, the accuracy of the effective stress can be improved by using
 a refined polymer grid.
 This is because stress overestimation near CNT endpoints and underestimation
 near the polymer-CNT interface can be eliminated when using a refined grid.
 However, the improvement of the displacement accuracy is not significant.

\begin_layout Subsection
An application of the Immersed FE method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this numerical example, the Immersed FE method is used to study mechanic
 properties of composites reinforced by the uniformly dispersed straight
 CNTs with different volume fraction.
 The CNT is selected to be Single-Walled (5,5) armchair with radius 
\begin_inset Formula $r=0.67\textrm{nm}$
\end_inset

 and length 
\begin_inset Formula $l=67\textrm{nm}$
\end_inset

.
 These CNTs are uniformly and fully dispersed in a brick RVE with size 
\begin_inset Formula $d=67\textrm{nm}$
\end_inset

.
 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

Fully dispersed
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 means that the minimal distance of any two CNTs in the net must larger
 than 
\begin_inset Formula $r_{\textrm{CNT_{1}}}+r_{\textrm{CNT_{2}}}+d_{\textrm{VDW}}$
\end_inset

 where 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{\textrm{VDW}}=0.34\textrm{nm}$
\end_inset

 is the distance of Van Der Waals force

 The volume fraction 
\begin_inset Formula $f$
\end_inset

 ranging from 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\%$
\end_inset

 to 
\begin_inset Formula $3\%$
\end_inset

 with 
\begin_inset Formula $\Delta f=0.5\%$
\end_inset

 are studied and at each fraction, 10 sets of random CNT net are created
 by Monte Carlo method.
 Periodic condition is applied at the RVE boundary.

\begin_layout Standard
In this study, we propose an Immersed Finite Element method to simulate
 the mechanical behavior of CNT-reinforced polymer.
 The CNT and polymer grid are allowed to be created independently, so it
 is able to easily handle the complex CNT morphology in reality.
 Both both kinematic and mechanic relations between CNT and polymer are
 considered by embedding the equilibrium equation of each CNT into the equilibri
um equation of polymer.
 Numerical examples indicate that the results of the Immersed FE method
 is very close to the traditional FE method, so it is able to provide reliable
 prediction of complicated problems.
 This method is used to studies the mechanic properties of composites reinforced
 by the uniformly dispersed straight CNTs in this paper.
 And the numerical results demonstrate that ...
