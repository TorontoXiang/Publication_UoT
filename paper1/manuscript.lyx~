\begin_layout Title
An Immersed Finite Element Method to Simulate the CNT-Reinforced Polymer
 with Complicated CNT Morphology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
FE method is one of the most useful approaches to study the mechanical propertie
s of a CNT-reinforced composite on bulk levels.
 However due to the extreme complexity of the CNT net morphology, it is
 almost impossible to create a FE model for a realistic composite.
 Multiple assumptions are made to reduce the difficulties of creating the
 FE model in the past decades, but they can only reveal part of the realistic
 phenomena.
 In this study, an Immersed FE method is proposed which allows for the CNT
 and polymer model to be created independently and simulated coupled.
 The basic assumption is the CNT and polymer are fully bonded, so the equilibriu
m equations of each CNT can be embed into the equilibrium equation of the
 polymer according to the Newton's third law.
 The most important advantage of the Immersed FE method is that the polymer
 can always be meshed as a regular grid no matter how complex the CNT nets
 are.
 So it possible to simulate realistic composites because the difficulty
 of creating a realistic CNT net model is much less than creating a realistic
 composite model.
 Numerical examples are presented to validate the results of the Immersed
 FE method are very close to the results of the traditional FE method.
 A simple application of the Immersed FE method is also presented which
 study the relationship between the CNT volume fraction and the effective
 material properties.

\begin_layout Section
Introduction and motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the area of nanocomposite science, the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted
 considerable interest due to their remarkable mechanical and physical propertie
s, such as such as low density[xxx], high Youngâ€™s modulus, strength and
 fracture strain[xxx] and high thermal and electrical conductivity[xxx].
 These superior properties make it an excellent choice to reinforce pure
 polymer as the multi-functional composite.
 In the past few decades, intensive attentions are paid to understand the
 mechanical behavior of the nanocomposite through experimental, theoretical
 and numerical studies[xxx].
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Numerical simulation is widely used in studying the mechanical properties
 of nanocomposites and a variety of modeling methods are developed for different
 scale of interest.
 The Molecular Dynamics (MD) method is designed for the nano-scale simulation.
 The constitutive relations of the MD method are derived from the inter-atomic
 potentials, and the motion of each atom in the system is based on the forces
 applying on it.
 MD method is able to see the details of every atom, so it can be used to
 study the complex phenomena in nano-scale, such as the interfacial properties
 between CNT and polymer[xxx], the effect of the chemical functionalization
 on carbon atoms[xxx] and the influence of the defect in the CNT[xxx].
 However, even with the usage of the most advanced supercomputers, only
 about 
\begin_inset Formula $10^{9}$
\end_inset

 atoms, namely about 1000 atoms in each direction, can be simulated[xxx].
 So it is unrealistic to use MD method in a larger scale.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To enlarge the simulation scale, the traditional continuum model is introduced
 which assumes the material to be homogeneous and neglects the details of
 atomic structures.
 Although the traditional continuum models cannot accurately describe the
 phenomena in nano-scale, it is able to provide valuable information to
 study the influences of the micro-scale parameters, such as the CNT curvature[x
xx], aspect ratio[xxx], and volume fraction[xxx], on the effective material
 properties of CNT-reinforced composites.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finite Element (FE) method is the most commonly used technique to simulate
 nanocomposites in micro-scale.
 However due to the extreme complexity of the CNT net morphology, such as
 waviness[xxx], agglomeration[xxx] and alignment[xxx], it is almost impossible
 to create a FE model for a realistic composite.
 The major challenge comes from the meshing process because traditional
 FE method requires the CNT and polymer grids to be matched to each other.
 The difficulty increases significantly with the increment of CNT number
 and morphological complexity.
 Lusti and Gusev created the traditional FE model of composites with straight
 CNTs and Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 shows the grid[xxx].
 It is obvious that the grid should be very difficult to be created and
 a lot of highly distorted meshes appear in Fig.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:The-traditional-FE"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

(b) which may decrease the accuracy of the results.
 The volume fraction of CNT is only 
\begin_inset Formula $0.5\%$
\end_inset

 but the composite is meshed into 
\begin_inset Formula $2.6\times10^{7}$
\end_inset

 elements.
 Alian and Meguid also used the traditional FE model to study the mechanical-ele
ctrical behavior of composites reinforced by straight CNTs, but due to the
 difficulties in meshing, the CNT volume fraction is only 
\begin_inset Formula $0.3\%$
\end_inset

 in their research[xxx].
 The problem can be even more severe when consider the waviness and agglomeratio
n of the realistic composites.

 The simplest way is to reduce the number of CNT and the morphological complexit
y.

Immersed Finite Element Method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we will introduce the theory of the Immersed Finite Element
 Method presented in this paper.
 Due to the polymer and CNT meshes are not matched, some assumptions are
 made in Section.

 CG (Conjugate Gradient) iteration is used to solve the governing equation

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The polymer and the CNTs are both meshed with 8 node hexahedral elements
 in the proposed Immersed FE method but they are not matched.
 So the basic assumption is the polymer and CNTs are fully bonded, namely
 the displacement of the CNT surface nodes equals to the local polymer displacem
ent.
 However in the Immersed FE method, the CNTs' grid are not matched with
 the polymer grid, so the displacement of the CNT surface nodes should be
 gathered from the surrounding polymer nodes.
 It should be mentioned that the fully bonded assumption is also used in
 many research using standard FE analysis.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once the surface displacement of the 
\begin_inset Formula $i^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 CNT, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}$
\end_inset

, is determined, the internal displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,I}}$
\end_inset

 and the reacting force 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}}$
\end_inset

 can be obtained by solving the equilibrium equation
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left[\begin{array}{cc}
\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,II}} & \boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,IB}}\\
\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,BI}} & \boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,BB}}
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,I}}\\
\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}
\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{0}\\
\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}}
\end{array}\right]\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}}$
\end_inset

 is the force that the polymer applies on the 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

, so the force that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

 applies on polymer is 
\begin_inset Formula $-\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}}$
\end_inset

.
 It should be mentioned that this force are not exactly applied on the polymer
 nodes, so it should be scattered to the surrounding polymer nodes.
 Since 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}$
\end_inset

 is calculated is from the polymer displacement 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}$
\end_inset

, the force that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

 applies on the polymer should also be a function of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}$
\end_inset

 and denote it as 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\right)$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Then, the equilibrium equation of polymer is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}=\sum_{i}\boldsymbol{F}_{i}\left(\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\right)+\boldsymbol{f}^{\textrm{Polymer,react}}\label{eq:2}

Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 is the governing equation of the Immersed FE method and after solving this

 leads to a linear equation with positive definite coefficient matrix in
 the following.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Suppose the number of freedom degree in the polymer grid is 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\textrm{P}}$
\end_inset

 and the number of the boundary freedom degree in 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}^{\textrm{B}}$
\end_inset

.
 For the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 boundary freedom degree in 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

, its displacement is gathered from the surrounding polymer nodes, namely
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
d_{ij}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}=\sum_{k=1}^{N^{\textrm{P}}}w_{jk}^{\textrm{d},i}d_{k}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\label{eq:3}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $w_{jk}^{\textrm{d},i}$
\end_inset

 is the contribution of the 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 polymer freedom degree to the 
\begin_inset Formula $j^{\textrm{th}}$
\end_inset

 boundary freedom degree of 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

 in the displacement gathering.
 Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}=\boldsymbol{w}_{\textrm{d},i}\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\label{eq:4}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{w}_{\textrm{d},i}$
\end_inset

 is the displacement gathering matrix with dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}^{\textrm{B}}\times N^{\textrm{P}}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The solution of Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref

\end_inset

 is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{eqnarray}
\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,react}} & = & \left(-\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,BI}}\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,II}^{-1}}\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,IB}}+\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,BB}}\right)\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}\nonumber \\
 & = & \boldsymbol{T}_{i}\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}\label{eq:5}
\end{eqnarray}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{T}_{i}$
\end_inset

 must be a positive definite matrix due the conservation of energy.
 Therefore, the force that 
\begin_inset Formula $\textrm{CNT}_{i}$
\end_inset

 applies on polymer is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{C2P}}=-\boldsymbol{T}_{i}\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and it should be scattered to the surrounding polymer nodes, namely
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{F}_{i}=\boldsymbol{w}_{\textrm{f},i}\boldsymbol{f}_{i}^{\textrm{C2P}}=-\boldsymbol{w}^{\textrm{f},i}\boldsymbol{T}_{i}\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{CNT,B}}\label{eq:7}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{w}_{\textrm{f},i}$
\end_inset

 is the force scattering matrix with dimension 
\begin_inset Formula $N^{\textrm{P}}\times N_{i}^{\textrm{B}}$
\end_inset

\end_inset

 into Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, we have
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{F}_{i}=-\boldsymbol{w}_{\textrm{f},i}\boldsymbol{T}_{i}\boldsymbol{w}_{\textrm{d},i}\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\label{eq:8}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, the isoparametric interpolation of the 8 node hexahedral
 element is used to gather displacement and scatter force.
 So 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{w}_{\textrm{f},i}=\boldsymbol{w}_{\textrm{d},i}^{\textrm{T}}$
\end_inset

, and Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:8"

\end_inset

 can be rewritten as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\boldsymbol{F}_{i}=-\boldsymbol{w}^{\textrm{T}}\boldsymbol{T}_{i}\boldsymbol{w}\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}=\boldsymbol{S}_{i}\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}\label{eq:9}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}_{i}$
\end_inset

 is a positive semi-definite matrix.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, Substituting Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

 into Eq.
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand eqref
reference "eq:2"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

\end_inset

 leads to
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{Polymer}}+\sum_{i}\boldsymbol{S}_{i}\right)\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}=\left(\boldsymbol{K}+\boldsymbol{S}\right)\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{Polymer}}=\boldsymbol{f}^{\textrm{Polymer,react}}\label{eq:10}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}+\boldsymbol{S}$
\end_inset

 is the total stiffness matrix of the nanocomposite which contains the original
 stiffness from the polymer, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}$
\end_inset

, and the reinforced stiffness from CNTs, namely 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Strictly speaking, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}$
\end_inset

 should not be equal to the stiffness matrix of the pure polymer 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}_{0}$
\end_inset

.
 This is because the CNTs in the composite occupy some space of the polymer
 and thus, decrease the stiffness of the polymer.
 Nevertheless, due to the fact that the volume fraction of the nanocomposite
 is very low ( generally less than 5% ), and the stiffness of CNT is much
 higher than that of the polymer ( about 300 times ), the magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}_{0}-\boldsymbol{K}$
\end_inset

 should be much less than the magnitude of 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}$
\end_inset

.
 So in this paper, 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}_{0}$
\end_inset

 is used in Eq.

\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}
\boldsymbol{0}\\
\boldsymbol{f}^{\textrm{react}}
\end{array}\right]
\end{equation}

\end_inset

and the Finally equation to be solved is
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\left(\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{II}}+\boldsymbol{S}^{\textrm{II}}\right)\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{I}}=-\left(\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{IB}}+\boldsymbol{S}^{\textrm{IB}}\right)\boldsymbol{d}^{\textrm{B}}\label{eq:12}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

It should be mentioned that 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{K}^{\textrm{II}}$
\end_inset

 is a positive definite matrix and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{S}^{\textrm{II}}$
\end_inset

 is a positive semi-definite matrix, so the coefficient matrix of Eq.

 and the CNT and polymer meshes are matched.
 The number of cells in the standard FEM model is 168300.
 In the Immersed FE model, the CNT grid is the same with that in the standard
 FEM while the polymer is meshed as a regular grid with 
\begin_inset Formula $30\times30\times150$
\end_inset

 cells.
 The number of cells in this two model is close, so they have a similar
 grid resolution.

 of the CNT are overestimated.
 The overestimation may occur if one or more CNT cells at the endpoint are
 fully inside a polymer cell, and it can be eliminated by using a refined
 polymer grid or a coarser CNT grid.

 The degree of the stress concentration phenomenon near the CNT's endpoints
 is underestimated due to the non-matched polymer and CNT grid, and it can
 also be eliminated by using a refined polymer grid as shown in Fig.

 It should be mentioned that the underestimation is localized because the
 equilibrium equation is a elliptic equation.
 Therefore, it would not produce obvious error when evaluating the effective
 material properties of the nanocomposite.

\begin_inset Formula $S$

 is the face area.
 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma_{xx}$
\end_inset

 from the standard FE method is 0.1487GPa while the it is 0.1493Gpa from my
 the Immersed.
 The effective stress from the non-mesh-matched method is slightly higher
 than the standard FE method which may caused by the overestimation of the
 CNT deformation near the CNT endpoints 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The displacement of each endpoint of the CNTs are also compared.
 An auxiliary variable is defined to measure the average displacement difference
 as
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
e=\frac{\sum_{i}\left|\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{SFE}}-\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{IFE}}\right|}{\sum_{i}\left|\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{SFE}}\right|}
\end{equation}

\end_inset

where 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{SFE}}$
\end_inset

and 
\begin_inset Formula $\boldsymbol{d}_{i}^{\textrm{IFE}}$
\end_inset

 are the displacement of each CNT endpoint from standard FE method and Immersed
 FE method, respectively.
 The numerical result shows that the average CNT endpoint displacement differenc
e is about 
\begin_inset Formula $5.66\%$
\end_inset

, and it indicates that the results from the Immersed FE method are very
 close to the standard FE method.
